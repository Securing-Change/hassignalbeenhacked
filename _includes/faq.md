## I heard that the Signal app was hacked or compromised. Is that true?
Probably not.


## But the person who told me has no reason to lie!
>Then ask them to provide a source that is more reliable than "trust me bro". Good examples of a reliable source might be a news story from a reputable publication or an academic study.


## I have a good source that shows Signal was compromised but the site still says "No".
>Find us on Mastodon and let us know.


## Why did you make this site?
>In the past few years, we've encountered a steady flow of rumors that the Signal app has been compromised, often accompanied by uninformed advice. Spreading these rumors can be incredibly harmful as it causes many people to needlessly lose trust in encrypted messenger apps and adopt less secure methods of communicating. This can also cause anxiety and paranoid thinking. While we can only speculate why these rumors keep spreading, we wanted to do something that could help stop them from gaining traction.

 
## Is this an official Signal app project?
>No.

 
## Well, then who are you?
>We are a group of privacy/security activists who are tired of debunking misinformation around what we consider to be the best encrypted messenger app for most people.

 
## How often is this site updated?
>The moment we are able to confirm that Signal has been compromised, we will update it. [Last update: March 26, 2025]

 
## What can I do to help stop misinformation?
>Don't spread information you can't verify yourself, and encourage others to do the same. Demand a source from anyone claiming that Signal has been compromised. Go search for a source yourself. Signal is one of the most important apps in the world, and had it actually been compromised, it would be widely reported.
